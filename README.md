# CustomerSurveyAssignment
git clone https://github.com/Loubnadali/CustomerSurveyAssignment.git



Create a Java program named CustomerSurvey that does the following:




1. Collect Customer Ratings

Continuously accept integer ratings from 1 to 5 until the user inputs -1 (sentinel value) to stop.
Only allow ratings within the range of 1 to 5; display an error message for invalid inputs.




2. Implementing Loop Types

Sentinel-Controlled Loop (while loop): Use this loop to continue accepting ratings until the sentinel value is entered.
Counter-Controlled Loop (for loop): Use this loop to calculate the count for each rating (1 to 5) and the average rating.
Flag-Controlled Loop (while loop): Implement a flag to detect if any rating of 5 was entered. If a rating of 5 is detected, display a message "Excellent rating received!" immediately after the input collection.




3. Summary Report


After all ratings have been collected, display the following:

Total number of ratings
Average rating
Count of each rating (1-star to 5-star)
